NDK: "invalid 'asm': operand number out of range" when compiling for x86 using gcc 4.6/4.7 (gcc 4.4.3 works)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Host OS: Debian testing (also fails on Ubuntu and other host os)
Android NDK version: 8e (newest)
Platform targeted by your project: x86 (armeabi works)

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Get minimal test case from github.com/dschuermann/android-ndk-asm-invalid
2. Execute ndk-build
3. Following error will happen: "jni/bug/ClassA.cpp:6:16: error: invalid 'asm': operand number out of range"

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Compiling works

OBSERVED RESULTS:
Compiling this class does not work under the following conditions:
- compiling fails at htonl() method
- compiling only fails when the class extends std::ostream

- targeted ABI is x86 (armeabi works)
- using gcc 4.6, 4.7 (gcc 4.4.3 and clang works)
- error occurs independently from stl lib (stlport and gnustl were tested)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
See Application.mk in the minimal test case for the used compiling configuration.
